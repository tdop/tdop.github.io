This repo exists to host [a remastered copy][0] of Vaughan Pratt's original 1973 paper,
*Top Down Operator Precedence*, which describes his profoundly beautiful parsing algorithm.

A PDF copy of the original paper was freely available from `hall.org.ua`, but it went offline
sometime around 2017. The repo includes an archived copy (see `original.pdf`), which we were
able to obtain [via the Wayback Machine][1].

Remastered by [Carl Smith][2], [Brian Campbell][3], [David Majda][4], [Corentin Smith][5],
[Brett Handley][6], [Kauê Rodrigues][7], [Paul Sokolovsky][8] and [Andreas Björkman][9].
